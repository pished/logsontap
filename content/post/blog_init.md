## Creating a Blog

Much like many other ideas I have, creating a blog has been wavering in and out of focus for me. First it started with how do I even make it, but that was the easy part. It was actually the biggest problem I kept having while creating this blog - I kept starting over on the technical side of how to create and deploy the blog instead of what kind of posts I was going to write. A lot of time was wasted in reading internet opinions on this framework vs that framework, leaving myself stuck in a near endless loop of unproductiveness. It is a blessing and a curse to be a developer at times because a machine already capable of so much becomes even more unlimited when you can actually code to your own imagination.

Most people need to use website designers such as Wix, Squarespace, or Wordpress. I got trapped with a lot more questions because I didn’t want to use any of the GUI designers so that I could see what it was like to go through a full build and deployment process for a personal website. Should I go with a static site generator (Gatsby, Hugo, Jekyll)? Should I code it from scratch? Which would be a better learning experience such that I can talk about it in interviews and mark it on my resume? I had a lot to think about and restarted using a different tool more than once.

Besides the question on framework, I also needed to figure out how I wanted to deploy it. I wanted to think about how to build it before creating it so that the build/deploy would be a lot easier and not an added on process. I wanted to find a cheap, and well known cloud provider so I could reliably host and possibly scale should I ever need to (extremely doubtful). A well known service provider would help in maintainability, I think, because it has less of a chance of randomly going under as well as the probability that it would need less work from me in the future. Hopefully, by getting AWS, Digital Ocean, or some other big name - it would reduce the chance that my blog would need to migrate.

## Picking a Specialization

I have been trying for the past year or so to figure out what part of the computer science field I want to participate in. I have heard stories from mentors in my company that the reason for their success is they picked something early on and specialized in it. They became the go-to person whenever a certain topic came up and soon enough they were a software architect. 

So I ask myself again, even while writing this post - what do I want to do? The way I see it, you can specialize in varying scopes of detail on a field with computers. Here are the current ones that I see as “specialization areas” (really feels like a video game, doesn’t it):

- Security
- Networking
- DevOps | SRE
- Software Developer
- Architect | Manager
- Mainframe?
- Cloud Engineer
- Data Science

When I was going through university, I didn’t have a goal - it was just general software development. There were some unique elective classes but most everything was focusing on becoming a software developer. I suppose that is a safe choice since almost all the other jobs require some degree of coding ability or knowledge of how coding works, however I still think a better job should be done on showing what actually working in the different fields is like. 

Perhaps that’s my biggest gripe with computer education - specifically for bachelor’s degrees. There seems to be such a disconnect from what working in the software world is versus what it seems like while sitting in a classroom. The influence of school on someone who has never been in the business seems to be the same as taking a random person to a conference they no nothing about. It is just not going to be that effective.

I’ve narrowed down the subjects I’m interested in pursuing as a career, but it is mostly done through opinions, day-in-the-life videos, mentors, and coding projects. There’s the debate that you shouldn’t worry and just let your specialization happen naturally - just start out as a generalist software developer. Some part of me agrees that it seems reasonable. It certainly  is easier for new grads to get a job since most companies hire based on academic CS knowledge. However, the practical part of me wants me to specialize as early as I can because I want to be that go-to person whenever the subject comes up.

## Plans for the Blog

A lot of what I like to do is mess around with Linux configurations and different distros. I want to make more open source contributions and become more of a community member because it is something that is unique to software and has really made an impression upon me. I like making utility CLI apps that help automate my life and the goal is to make them better structured and more featured so they are actually scripts that I am proud of rather than ashamed repos that I hide away to cover up my crappy programming.

I don’t have a specific goal in mind. I enjoy devops (hence the blog name) as well as just hobby coding so I think those are what my primary articles will be about. I also like to overthink on benign topics so I might provide some commentary on that. Overall my goal is to just make a somewhat interesting blog that doesn’t spam with ads or email links and makes an easy contribution to a RSS feed so you don’t have to click a hyperlink to get the full content.
