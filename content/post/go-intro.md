## A Brief Dip into Go

[Go | Golang ] is an open-sourced language created by Ken Thompson, Rob Pike, and Robert Griesemer at Google. Originally, the compiler was written in `C` but since then it has been [rewritten in Go](https://github.com/golang/go). The original goal of Go was to replace traditional low-level languages like `C` and `C++` and build upon them by offering improved simplicity.

Notable Go features:
- Is a compiled, statically typed language
- Focused around concurrency through use of GoRoutines
- Key distinction from C/C++ with built-in garbage collection and memory safety
- Strings default as UTF-8 encoded[^1]
- Borrows much syntax of modern interpreted languages
