This site is mostly just a collection of my digitized notes. I have organized them into notebook subjects to hopefully make it easier to track them - otherwise it would just be a losely related collection of tags.

I don't really intend for this website to scale too much so I didn't build it to be "hug-of-death" proof. If it does go down it would just be because of a spike in readers.

Not sure what else to say, so I'll just list my favorite languages in order:
+ Go
+ Python
+ Bash
+ Dart
